## Project: MoneyTrail v1.0 - v2.1

MoneyTrail is a lightweight, user-friendly budget tracking 
application designed to help you keep track of your expenses, 
monitor your spending habits, and achieve your financial goals.
It is written in Java and is designed specifically for CLI users.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=rchlai&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2025-02-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

- **Implementations**: 
  - New class: Created the `MoneyTrail` skeleton main class to kickstart the project
    - Highlight: The majority of the initial running codes are inspired by early workings on the iP project.

  - New class: Created a `MoneyList` class to manage a list of entries
    - What it does: It keeps all related logic (e.g., adding, deleting, updating) in one place.
    - Justification: The class can be reused across different parts of the app without rewriting the same logic.
    - Highlight: This implementation follows the **Single Responsibility Principle**, making the code easier to maintain and debug.

  - New class: Created a `Storage` class for handling data persistence
    - What it does: It handles data saving and loading operations to and from a file source `mt.txt`.
    - Justification: The class hides low-level file operations (e.g., opening/closing files) behind simple methods like save(data) and load(). Other parts of the app don’t need to know how data is stored—just that it works.

  - New class: Created a `MTException` class for handling exceptions
    - What it does: It handles errors and exceptional scenarios in a structured and user-friendly way and provide meaningful feedback to users.

  - New class: Created a `MTLogger` class for logging purposes.
    - What it does: It keeps a record of user activities, events, and errors for audit and easier debugging.

  - New class: Created a `TextUI` class to handle all the text-based user interface interactions.
    - What it does: It separates user interface logic from business logic (like data storage).
    - Justification: This makes the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more modular.

  - New feature: Added the ability to delete entries.
    - What it does: It allows the user to remove entries from the list using the delete command. This action, however, is irreversible.
    - Justification: It improves the product by enabling users to remove outdated, duplicate, and mistakenly entered entries. Removing old entries also allows users to read the list easier.
    - Highlight: The implementation is fairly easy since the codes are copied from an existing project and then tweaked with minor adjustments.

  - New feature: Added the ability to clear all entries
    - What it does: It allows users to clear all existing entries.
    - Justification: This caters to users who may want to reset their budget without old data influencing new records. It also helps in maintaining a clean slate for better financial planning.
